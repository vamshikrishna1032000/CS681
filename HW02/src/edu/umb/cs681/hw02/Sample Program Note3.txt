Sample Program






When you use  Collectors' methods, you often need to write down
"Collectors" again and again; for example:


...collect(Collectors.partitioningBy(
         p->{p.getAge()>=18 && p.getVacCount()>=3},
         Collectors.averagingDouble(
             p-> p.getVacCount() )));


By using "static import", you can omit "Collectors" like:


...collect(partitioningBy(
         p->{p.getAge()>=18 && p.getVacCount()>=3},
         averagingDouble(
             p-> p.getVacCount() )));


Try to do this if you like it. See a CS680 lecture note about static
import. It is covered in a lec note about JUnit.
